Heads up that the clarifai API has been updated since I made the next video. You will get an error using Clarifai.DETECT_FACE,  it appears to have changed to Clarifai.FACE_DETECT_MODEL.

Also, the URL in the next video has also been updated. Keep this in mind as you go through the exercise:



app.models
.predict(
Clarifai.COLOR_MODEL,
    // URL
    "https://samples.clarifai.com/metro-north.jpg"
)
.then(function(response) {
    // do something with responseconsole.log(response);
    },
    function(err) {// there was an error}
);
